Strangler Pattern
The Strangler Pattern is a software development strategy used to gradually refactor or migrate a legacy system to a new system without disrupting the existing functionality. It allows for incremental replacement, reducing the risk of failure by enabling gradual transition.

How the Strangler Pattern Works:
Identify the Legacy System:

Identify the parts of the system that need to be replaced or refactored.
Example: A legacy monolithic e-commerce platform.
Build the New System or Component:

Start building the new system or module alongside the legacy system.
Example: Build a new microservice-based product catalog system.
Route Requests to New and Old Systems:

Set up a routing mechanism that directs a portion of the traffic to the new system while the legacy system continues to handle the rest.
Example: Requests to update product listings could go to the new service, while browsing remains on the legacy system.
Incrementally Migrate Functionality:

Gradually move more functionality from the legacy system to the new system in phases, replacing old parts of the system as the new system is completed and tested.
Example: Move the checkout process to the new system after product catalog and order services are migrated.
Decommission Legacy Components:

Once all functionality has been migrated to the new system, retire or decommission the old system.
Example: After the full migration, the legacy catalog and order systems are removed.
Advantages of the Strangler Pattern:
Low Risk:

Since only a part of the system is replaced at any given time, there's minimal disruption to ongoing operations.
Incremental Change:

Allows for gradual adoption of new technology without needing a complete rewrite, which reduces risk and cost.
Allows for Testing:

The new system can be tested in parallel with the legacy system, enabling real-world validation before full migration.
Easier Rollback:

If an issue arises, itâ€™s easier to revert back to the legacy system or halt further migration.
Disadvantages of the Strangler Pattern:
Complexity in Routing:

The routing logic between the old and new systems can become complex as more functionality is migrated, increasing the operational overhead.
Increased Maintenance:

During the transition, both the legacy and new systems need to be maintained, leading to extra work and potential duplication.
Possible Duplication of Functionality:

There might be temporary duplication of features across the old and new systems as functionality is transitioned.
Example Use Case:
Imagine a traditional monolithic application that handles all the functionalities of an online store, from catalog management to orders and payments. A company wants to migrate to a microservices-based architecture. The strangler pattern allows them to:

Replace one part of the monolithic system (e.g., the catalog) with a microservice.
Route catalog-related requests to the new microservice while leaving the rest of the monolith intact.
Gradually replace other features (like orders, payments) until the entire monolith is replaced.
Finally, decommission the old monolith once the transition is complete.
The Strangler Pattern helps in migrating legacy systems gradually without causing disruption, ensuring a smooth transition to new architectures.
